### Hi there, I'm Pach! ðŸ‘‹

A generalist engineering manager with a knack for **delightful** and **usable UIs**. I love building & documenting design systems, user-centered web apps, cool websites and interactive pieces with React, NodeJs, vanila JavaScript, [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/), Github, Netlify and super optimised CSS!

I have extensive industry experience. From established brands like [British Telecom](https://bt.com), [Vodafone](https://vodafone.com), [Unilever](https://unilever.com), [Royal Opera House](https://roh.org.uk) or [M&S](https://marksandspencer.com) to tech start-ups like [Knack](https://knack.com/), [TableCheck](https://www.tablecheck.com/en/join) or the digital agency I co-founded called Webmarket.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as an engineering manager at [Knack](https://knack.com), a SaaS company with a no-code builder. If you're curious, please go ahead and try to create an app. It's super easy.

- ðŸ‘¯ In the future, Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with other engineers and finish building [Hypatia](https://github.com/gazpachu/hypatia), the React [LMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_management_system) I started a few years ago. A lot of people showed interested in the project and I feel that this open source story needs to continue, since the aim is to give something back to the OSS community and to the world that can make education a bit better ðŸ’™

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything

- âš¡ Fun fact: I have many interests and hobbies but, even if I've been building websites and apps for 20+ years, I still get excited with the idea of creating a new one, even if it's a small one!
