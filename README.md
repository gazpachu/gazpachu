### Hi there, I'm Pach! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a generalist front-end engineering manager with a knack for **delightful** and **usable UIs**. I love building & documenting design systems, user-centered web apps and interactive pieces with React, vanila JavaScript, [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/), Github, Netlify and super optimised CSS!

I have extensive industry experience. From tech start-ups like [TableCheck](https://www.tablecheck.com/en/join) to solid brands like [British Telecom](https://bt.com), [Vodafone](https://vodafone.com), [Unilever](https://unilever.com), [Royal Opera House](https://roh.org.uk), [M&S](https://marksandspencer.com) and more.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at [TableCheck](https://www.tablecheck.com/en/join), managing a global team of 9 front-end engineers (in Asia and Europe) working on different projects. Together we have built [TableKit](https://tablekit.tablecheck.com), TableCheck's Design System. We are working on the 3rd version now, which will use CSS variables, super accessible UI components and have a very lightweight JS footprint! We are inspired by [PicoCSS](https://picocss.com/).

- ðŸ‘¯ In the future, Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with other engineers and finish building [Hypatia](https://github.com/gazpachu/hypatia), the React [LMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_management_system) I started a few years ago. A lot of people showed interested in the project and I feel that this open source story needs to continue, since the aim is to give something back to the OSS community and to the world that can make education a bit better ðŸ’™

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him

- âš¡ Fun fact: I have many interests and hobbies but, even if I've been building websites for 20+ years, I still get excited with the idea of building a new one, even if it's a small one! I really love the Internet... ðŸ˜‰
